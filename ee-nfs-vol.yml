# TODO:
# - Test from an EE image since testing was local using a-core..
# - Create a role for file creation on NFS 
# - Update documentation
# - dynamic file name of some sort
#   - looping on file creations and/or directory creations in NFS
# - validate the fileshare permissions from the mounted volume in the 
#   EE Node OS.  Seems the 'awx' user needs 'rwx' perms to that newly
#   mounted volume/folder...  Double check this..
